# Bitcoin Whitepaper
The Bitcoin Whitepaper titled **_Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System_** was published on **_31 October 2008_** by Satoshi Nakamoto.

The paper details a method of using a peer-to-peer network to generate what is described as **_"a system for electronic transactions without relying on trust"_**

Prior to that, on the 18 August 2008, the domain name bitcoin.org was registered.

On **_3 January 2009_**, the bitcoin network came into existence with Satoshi Nakamoto mining the genesis block of bitcoin (block number 0), which had a reward of 50 bitcoins. Embedded in the coinbase of this block is the text:

**_The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks._**

The text refers to a headline in The Times published on 3 January 2009. This note is both a timestamp of the genesis date and a derisive comment on the instability caused by fractional-reserve banking.
